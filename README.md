##  üê∏ Description 

:construction: THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS :construction:

This is a GraphQL API written with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) for **Animal Crossing: New Horizons**. The data is from [Data Spreadsheet for Animal Crossing New Horizons](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13d_LAJPlxMa_DubPTuirkIV4DERBMXbrWQsmSh8ReK4/).  Thanks for providing this ‚ù§

If you want to access the Spreadsheet Data you currently have to create a .env file and set the `API_KEY` variable from the Google API ([How to get one](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys)).

I am using the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) emoji guide for commit messages.
